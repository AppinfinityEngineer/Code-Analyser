Mini Pipeline Requirements Document
General Overview
Develop a mini data pipeline using PySpark and Python that:

Ingests input data in a specified format (e.g., JSON, Parquet, or CSV).
Transforms the data according to predefined rules.
Exports the transformed data as a CSV file.
Functional Requirements
Data Ingestion

Read input data from a specified file path.
Support common input formats, including JSON, Parquet, and CSV.
Data Transformation

Apply specified transformations to the input data, such as:
Column renaming.
Data type casting (e.g., casting string to integer).
Filtering rows based on specified conditions.
Adding derived columns (e.g., calculated fields).
Ensure transformations are modular, allowing easy modification and addition of new steps.
Data Output

Save the transformed data as a CSV file.
Ensure the output path can be specified as a parameter.
Add options to configure CSV settings such as delimiter and header inclusion.
Technical Requirements
Programming Languages

Use PySpark for data ingestion, transformation, and output.
Use Python for any additional functions or utility scripts as needed.
Notebook Environment

Implement the pipeline in a PySpark notebook.
Ensure all transformation steps are contained in a single notebook, allowing the pipeline to be run end-to-end.
Modularity and Clean Code

Ensure code is modular and easy to maintain.
Implement each transformation step as a separate function.
Include logging where appropriate to track each step of the pipeline.
Configuration Parameters

Allow parameters for:
Input and output paths.
CSV settings (e.g., delimiter, header).
Store configuration parameters at the beginning of the notebook for easy modification.
Error Handling

Include error handling for file input/output errors.
Add validations for data types and column existence before transformations.
Log and handle exceptions in transformation steps.
Non-Functional Requirements
Performance

Ensure efficient reading and writing of large datasets with PySpark.
Minimize memory usage by applying transformations in a streamlined manner.
Scalability

Design the pipeline to be extendable for additional transformations or output formats.
Documentation

Use docstrings to document functions, specifying input parameters and output.
Provide a brief overview of the pipeline steps at the beginning of the notebook.
